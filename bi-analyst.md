# Use of SQL 
## Objective
1. Using SQL to extract insights from data within our test environment, answer some example business questions. This is a pairing exercise, a developer will be available to support you throughout

## Question
1. Identify the most common reason for a By Miles member to cancel their policy

   **Hint:** 
   The table of interest is called `mtas`. 
   The `mtas` table contains a row for every 
     * policy cancellation (`type = 'cn'`)
     * policy change (mid-term adjustment) `(type = 'mta')`
     * policy renewal `(type = 'rn')`
  
1. How would you identify how the most common cancellation reason has changed over the last 6 months, on a month-by-month basis?

## Guidelines
1. You will be provided access to our test environment through a web browser and will be asked to share your screen through Google Meet 
1. You are free to use the internet to research throughout the exercise
1. You are free to extract the data to further analyse it locally using tools you are familiar with
1. We are interested in the clarifying questions you ask as well as the implementation
